# My-Event-App

MyEvent App is developed for users to track their events from the touch of their fingers from anywhere. The app simply add/remove events from the event list and notify you via SMS.&nbsp;


I try to keep the UI Design as simple as possible and easy to understand for the users. The first screen is the login page, where users enter their credentials to login to check their upcoming events. After successful login, the user will be able to see their current event activity. On the right bottom corner, there is an add button, which lets you add Upcoming event details. After adding event, the app redirects you to the second page, where you will be able to see upcoming events. When you have multiple events, which are going to occupy more screen space. Then you will see scroll bar to the right (using Recycler View). Each event is going to have a name and date with edit and check mark icon. When designing UI screens for my project, I reviewed the Design for Android guidelines to make sure the designs are user-driven and compatible with mobile architecture.

The coding part of the mobile application was overwhelming and exhausting. But I was able to make the code clean, reusable, and modular for maintenance, upgrades and debug purposes. After implementing each functionality, I run the app on the emulator to test the code to make sure it's functional and it is not going to break once it's in production.&nbsp;


There were many obstacle throughout the journey, I was able to overcome those by searching for solution in documentation, googling, and use of other resources.
